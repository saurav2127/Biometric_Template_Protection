# Biometric_Template_Protection

Designed and refined a secure biometric system to safeguard scanned facial data as unforgeable templates. This involved the integrated  of various deep learning models with advanced cryptographic techniques to devise an ideal template to store the facial data. Implemented and tested multiple template formats to ensure data integrity and privacy for emphasizing the fusion of deep learning and security principles.
